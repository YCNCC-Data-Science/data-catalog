        "description": "A 1D reactive transport model designed to  (1) mechanistically simulate natural weathering,  (2) allow targeted addition of solid phases at the soil-atmosphere interface,  (3) implement a range of soil mixing regimes as catalyzed by soil surface fauna or humans, and (4) enable calculation of solid mineral surface area based on controlled initial particle size distributions coupled to a shrinking core framework.\n",
